        Dive deep into the history of the ACB, exploring how the league began
        and evolved over time, from its early days to its current status as a
        major basketball competition in Spain.

          <p>
            Founded in 1983 as the Asociación de Clubs de Baloncesto (ACB), the
            league was established to provide a more structured and competitive
            platform for Spanish basketball. It quickly gained recognition for
            its high level of play and the development of top domestic talent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ACB's prominence grew in the 1990s and 2000s, highlighted by the
            success of teams like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. The league
            became known for its intense competition and the emergence of future
            stars who would go on to make significant impacts in European and
            global basketball.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the ACB is one of the leading basketball leagues in Europe,
            showcasing elite talent and contributing significantly to the
            sport’s development. Its history is rich with competitive play,
            memorable moments, and a strong commitment to advancing basketball
            in Spain.

      <h1>2024 Champion</h1>
      <p>
        Real Madrid defeated Murcia on the road by 84:73, claiming the Liga
        Endesa title with a 3-0 win in the finals.

            After the previous game, everything centered around Rudy Fernandez,
            for whom this finals series marks a farewell to club basketball.
            After his appearances for the Spanish national team, he will retire.
            Murcia put up a good fight in Game 2, and they started Game 3
            fantastically well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Murcia managed to narrow the deficit to five points midway through
            the final period, but then Mario Hezonja, paired with Dzanan Musa,
            took control with 13 additional points for Real Madrid. This proved
            more than enough to secure victory in the end, earning them a
            consolation prize after their loss in the EuroLeague final.
          </p>
          <p>
            This marks Real Madrid’s 15th Liga Endesa title in the club’s
            history, closing in on Barcelona, who have won Liga Endesa title 17
            times.
