            Founded in 1958 as the European Champions Cup, the EuroLeague began
            as a competition for the top teams in European basketball. The
            league evolved over the decades, becoming the official EuroLeague in
            2000, with a format and structure designed to enhance the level of
            competition and visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2000s saw the EuroLeague grow in stature, driven by the
            participation of top clubs from across Europe and the emergence of
            standout players. Teams like Real Madrid, CSKA Moscow, and
            Panathinaikos became dominant forces, showcasing the high level of
            basketball across the continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the EuroLeague stands as a leading basketball competition in
            Europe, featuring elite teams and top international talent. Its
            history is marked by significant milestones, memorable games, and a
            commitment to promoting and advancing the sport of basketball across
            Europe.

        Athens side Panathinaikos have sensationally ended a 13-year wait for a
        Euroleague title with an enthralling run to glory this term.

            The series was a showcase of intense competition and skill, with
            both teams delivering exceptional performances. The Celtics
            demonstrated their resilience and strategic prowess, ultimately
            outlasting the Mavericks in a hard-fought battle.

          <p>
            23 wins and 11 losses in the regular basketball season was the
            catalyst for their run to the Final Four, where they overcame
            Fenerbah√ße in the semi-final, 73-57.
