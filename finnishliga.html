            Founded in 1975, the Liiga, originally known as the SM-liiga, was

            future stars.

            The Liiga's prominence grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
            highlighted by the success of teams such as Tappara and Kärpät. The
            league became known for its competitive play and the development of
