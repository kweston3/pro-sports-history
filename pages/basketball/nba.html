            Founded on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America
            (BAA), the NBA emerged from a merger with the National Basketball
            League (NBL) in 1949. The league quickly gained popularity through
            the 1950s and 1960s, featuring legends like Bill Russell and Wilt
            Chamberlain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NBA continued to rise in prominence during the 1970s and 1980s,
            driven by the rivalry between Larry Bird's Celtics and Magic
            Johnson's Lakers. The 1990s saw a global expansion, largely fueled
            by Michael Jordanâ€™s dominance and the impact of international stars
            like Hakeem Olajuwon and Dirk Nowitzki.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the NBA is a global powerhouse, showcasing top talent and
            influencing basketball worldwide. Its history is rich with legendary
            players, memorable moments, and an ongoing commitment to advancing
            the sport.
