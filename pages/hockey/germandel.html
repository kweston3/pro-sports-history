          <p>
            Founded in 1994, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) was established
            to provide a structured and competitive platform for ice hockey in
            Germany. It quickly became the premier league in the country,
            uniting the top teams and elevating the level of play.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DEL's growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s was marked by the
            introduction of new teams and the increasing presence of
            international players. The league became known for its high-paced
            games and the development of local talent, contributing to the
            popularity of ice hockey in Germany.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 2010s and 2020s, the DEL continued to expand its influence,
            with teams like Eisbären Berlin and Adler Mannheim achieving
            significant success. The league's commitment to high-quality
            competition and its role in nurturing hockey talent have solidified
            its position as a leading force in European ice hockey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the DEL stands as a major professional hockey league in
            Germany, known for its exciting play and its contributions to the
            development of the sport both domestically and internationally.

            After finishing second in the DEL regular season, Berlin beat the
            Fischtown Pinguins in five games in the finals
          </p>
          <p>
            On Friday night, Eisbären Berlin defeated the Fischtown Pinguins on
            the road in Bremerhaven 2-0 to win the DEL finals four games to one.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the fifth game scoreless early in the third period, Leo Pföderl
            scored what proved to be the title-winning goal, firing a rocket
            from the top of the circle that beat Bremerhaven goaltender
            Maximilian Franzreb inside the far post. With 15 points in 15 games
            to lead all scorers, Pföderl was named playoff MVP.
