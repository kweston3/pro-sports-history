          <p>
            Founded on November 26, 1917, as the National Hockey League (NHL),
            the league was established in Montreal, Canada, as a replacement for
            the National Hockey Association (NHA). The NHL initially consisted
            of four teams and began to grow in popularity as the sport of ice
            hockey gained traction across North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NHL's expansion in the 1960s and 1970s saw the introduction of
            new teams and the rise of iconic players such as Wayne Gretzky and
            Bobby Orr. The league's growth during this period established it as
            a major force in professional sports, with teams from both Canada
            and the United States contributing to its development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1990s and 2000s marked a new era of global expansion and
            increased competitiveness, driven by the inclusion of international
            stars and the introduction of new technologies and media coverage.
            Today, the NHL stands as a leading professional hockey league, known
            for its high level of play, legendary players, and ongoing
            commitment to advancing the sport globally.

            In what was the longest NHL season to date, you were able to watch
            regular season hockey, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2024 Stanley
            Cup Final on ABC and the ABC app as the quest for the Cup concluded
            with the first-ever title for those cool cats from the Sunshine
            State. It was a fitting finale after a series of fierce battles
            between two of the NHL's elite teams.
