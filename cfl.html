            Founded in 1958 as the Canadian Football League (CFL), the league
            was established to organize and elevate the sport of Canadian
            football. It quickly gained recognition for its unique style of play
            and contributions to the development of football in Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CFL's prominence grew during the 1970s and 1980s, highlighted by
            the success of teams like the Edmonton Eskimos and the Winnipeg Blue
            Bombers. The league became known for its passionate fan base and the
            emergence of stars who would become legends in Canadian football.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the CFL stands as a key fixture in Canadian sports,
            showcasing top talent and maintaining a strong tradition of
            competitive football. Its history is marked by memorable games,
            legendary players, and a deep commitment to promoting and advancing
            the sport of football in Canada.

            These are the names that will come to mind first when thinking about
            Montreal’s 28-24 win over Winnipeg in the 110th Grey Cup…and for
            darn good reason. But the Alouettes don’t pull off their incredible
            comeback without contributions up and down the roster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sankey joining the Als may have been the biggest turning point of
            their season, and not just because he declared they weren’t going to
            lose again after his debut. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then,
            that Sankey made a huge difference against the Bombers. After all,
            that’s all he did in Montreal’s first two playoff games and in his
            six regular season games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sankey led the Alouettes with eight defensive tackles in Sunday’s
            Grey Cup, which is par for the course knowing he also led the CFL in
            that category in both 2021 and 2022. Sankey was a menace from start
            to finish and found himself in Winnipeg’s backfield multiple times;
            he also finished with a sack in the victory.
