        and evolved over time, from its early days to its current status as one
        of Italy’s premier football leagues.

          <p>
            Founded in 1898, Serie A began as the Italian Football Championship
            and was officially renamed Serie A in 1929. The league was
            established to provide a structured and competitive platform for
            Italian football, quickly becoming known for its tactical play and
            high level of competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serie A’s prominence surged in the 1960s and 1980s, with clubs like
            AC Milan, Inter Milan, and Juventus becoming dominant forces. The
            league gained international acclaim for its world-class players and
            innovative strategies, contributing to its reputation as one of the
            best leagues in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1990s and 2000s, Serie A continued to attract top talent and
            maintain its status as a football powerhouse. Despite facing
            challenges in the 2010s, the league remains known for its passionate
            fan base and competitive play.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Serie A is celebrated for its rich history, iconic teams, and
            significant contributions to the sport of football. Its legacy
            includes memorable matches, legendary players, and a deep commitment
            to excellence in Italian football.

        Inter become Serie A champions with derby win over Milan, earn 'second
        star' for historic 20th Scudetto win

            Inter have won the 2023-24 Serie A title after an incredible season.
            The team coached by Simone Inzaghi has secured its 20th Serie A
            title, the second-most of any in Italy, behind only Juventus. The
            Nerazzurri lead the league from wire to wire and deserved to win
            locking up the historic Scudetto in a season where they absolutely
            demolished the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            By winning the 2023-24 title, Inter win the 20th Scudetto in their
            history, the so-called second star. In Italian soccer, teams that
            win at least ten Serie A titles can sew one star on their jerseys,
            twenty gets you two, and so on . Inter, from next season, can
            officially show their second star on the official jersey and logo.
            The Nerazzurri become the second Italian team, after Juventus and
            their 36 Serie A titles, to be entitled to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also the first Scudetto for manager Simone Inzaghi, who
            finally made his dream true. Inzaghi joined Inter in the summer of
            2021 to replace Antonio Conte, only a few days after the Nerazzurri
            won their 19th title.
