            Founded in 1993 as part of the United States' bid to host the 1994
            FIFA World Cup, Major League Soccer (MLS) began play in 1996. The
            league was established to provide a stable and competitive platform
            for professional soccer in the U.S. and Canada, initially featuring
            ten teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            MLS’s early years were marked by growing pains and financial
            challenges, but the league began to gain traction in the 2000s with
            the introduction of designated player rules and expansion to new
            markets. Teams like the LA Galaxy and Toronto FC emerged as
            influential forces, attracting international stars and increasing
            the league’s visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 2010s and 2020s, MLS continued to expand and evolve, with new
            teams joining the league and a growing emphasis on youth development
            and international talent. The league’s commitment to growth and
            improvement has established it as a significant player in the global
            soccer landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, MLS is recognized for its dynamic play, passionate fan base,
            and ongoing efforts to elevate soccer in North America. Its history
            reflects a journey of growth and innovation, contributing to the
            sport's development across the continent.

            The MLS Cup final set a new attendance record for Lower.com Field
            with 20,802 spectators, including 1,700 LAFC supporters.[81][82] The
            Crew had the majority of possession in the first half and limited
            chances for Los Angeles to counterattack. The continued pressure in
            LAFC's penalty area led to a handball by Diego Palacios that earned
            the Crew a penalty kick, which was converted in the 33rd minute by
            Cucho Hernández.[83][82] Heavy rain began to fall after the goal as
            the Crew continued to press forward. After Aidan Morris intercepted
            a pass by Ryan Hollingshead, the Crew made 11 passes upfield to
            reach Yaw Yeboah, who scored the second goal of the match.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Crew led 2-0 at half-time, having avoided a potential own goal
            in stoppage time. LAFC responded by sending more players upfield and
            leaving themselves vulnerable to counterattacks; an attempt by
            Yeboah was saved off the goal line by Palacios early in the
            half.[82] Dénis Bouanga scored in the 74th minute from a rebound
            after his first shot was saved by goalkeeper Patrick Schulte with
            his face. Schulte was treated on-field after the play but was able
            to continue.[83] The Crew were able to prevent an equalizer from
            LAFC and won 2-1 to clinch their third MLS Cup title.
